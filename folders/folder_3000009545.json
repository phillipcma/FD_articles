Ticket with some FR/custom development is received  We basically want to eliminate custom developments.\u00a0Thus if you received some feature request from client, please use the following Canned Response and link ticket to Jira (stage 1) for further review on the\u00a0Triage:  \u00a0  We currently do not support the feature you have described, however, \nwe have put your request into our product backlog. \nThis means that the feature request will be considered for implementation in a future release.\nIf the status of the feature changes to planned or implementation, then we may reach out to you\nat that time with questions or feedback.  \u00a0  Stage 1: A new Freshdesk ticket to development   Support engineer has a ticket that should be forwarded to the developers.\u00a0  He/She should setup the appropriate Freshdesk fields and click update button to apply changes:        Stage 2: Link FD with Jira      1. Before creation of a new Jira ticket, please login to Jira (https://sippysoft.atlassian.net) and re-check if the requested feature or bug doesn't exist on Jira already;     2.

If ticket on Jira doesn't exist, please create a new Jira ticket.     Use always \"Project\" = \"Triage\".\u00a0  \"Issue Type\" could be different. Follow logic and set the most suitable value (if you found a bug in the ticket, use \"issue type\" = \"bug\", etc.)  \"Assignee\"\u00a0could be \"Arthur Kamyshniy, Oleksandr Nykytiuk, Pavel Bussel\" but better leave it Unassigned.   \"Summary\"\u00a0- subject of the issue/bug/feature etc.   \"Reporter\"\u00a0for support should match the Jira login of the engie who links the ticket    \u00a0 \u00a03.1 Modify a jira ticket before delegation it to Arthur/Anton/Pavel/Alex for further Triage:          Notify Arthur/Anton/Pavel in RYVER chat (support talks room) about newly created ticket and they will discuss it on Triage then.    3.2\u00a0Send a newly created jira ticket (or reopened ticket) to Anton/Arthur/Pavel/Alex via email or directly via chat to discuss it further on the TRIAGE.  Stage 3: Jira tickets Triage  Participators on the Triage are: Phillip M., Arthur K., Anton H., Alex N., Pavel B., and a rotating Developer; On the \"Triage\" meeting, participants will discussing a new (and time permitting existing) tickets from the Support Triage queue. \u00a0At this time the issue's priority, business impact, and relevance will be evaluated and weighed against developer time to implement. \u00a0Once these factors have been evaluated these will be slotted into an appropriate time and place. \u00a0Not all items will be corrected through this process and emphasis should be geared towards priority, difficulty, and it's potential benefits for all our customers.   Comments will be added to the Jira ticket. \u00a0Comment should be forwarded automatically to the appropriate Freshdesk ticket that was linked with Jira ticket earlier. Also the \"TR\"(Triage) ticket is moving to \"SS\"(Sippy Softswitch) queue if it was approved by participators.

Support staff checks ALL FD tickets linked to the Jira TT upon receiving the comment from Jira and posts the reply to the customer/changes the status of the linked tickets accordingly    Stage 4: Support replies to the client about status of development (after Triage)  There are two possible decisions:   development has been approved\u00a0on the stage of Triage  If \"Triage\" participators decided to move forward with the development of the requested functionality, support staff replies to the customer about the status of the development and assign for the Freshdesk ticket a new status \"Wait on Dev Scrum\"  \u00a0development has been declined\u00a0on the stage of triage   If \"Triage\" participators decided to decline the requested development, support staff replies to the client with the existing canned response \"Feature request has been totally declined\"     Support staff checks ALL FD tickets linked to the Jira TT upon receiving the comment from Jira and posts the reply to the customer/changes the status of the linked tickets accordingly.     NOTE, support engineer should provide an explanation to customer why the issue has been declined if some reason has been provided as a comment in the Jira ticket. The related line is marked in bold in the canned response.   Stage 5: Change status for Freshdesk ticket  Status of Freshdesk ticket directly depends on Stage 4.     if the development has been approved\u00a0on the Triage, then apply the following values for the ticket fields:       if the development has been declined, then apply the following values for the ticket fields:      Stage 5: Dev planning session  Participators: Maxim S., Phillip M., Pavel B., Andriy P., Eugen D.; Development planning Sessions occur roughly every 2-3 weeks. \u00a0On the \"Dev Planning Session\" participants making a final decision about the discussed on the \"Triage\" tickets.\u00a0After the \"Dev Planning Session\", Pavel leaves a comment on Jira with some agreed decision (like \"Added to sprint 10\" or development declined).  Support staff checks ALL FD tickets linked to the Jira TT upon receiving the comment from Jira and posts the reply to the customer/changes the status of the linked tickets accordingly.    if development has been approved, support engineer doing a change in\u00a0status\u00a0to the new one \"Closed/Awaiting for the implementation\" for all freshdesk tickets that are linked with one Jira ticket and using canned response \"Closed/Awaiting for the implementation\" notify clients manually:        See auto-reply for the full understanding of process:\u00a0 Dear customer,\n\nThis is an automated notification! We would like to update you about the status change in your ticket.\nThe case has been placed to the backlog of our developers so that they can consider it in further versions of the product.\n\nCurrently we do not have the final estimations for the feature to be delivered, we'll let you know when the development is done.\nIf you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us by replying to this email.  \u00a0   if development\u00a0declined, support is closing ALL linked Freshdesk tickets and answer to each ticket with the existing canned response \"Development Declined\";   NOTE, support engineer should provide an explanation to customer why the issue has been declined if some reason has been provided as a comment in the Jira ticket.

Stage 6: Development is ready  Support staff checks ALL FD tickets linked to the Jira TT upon receiving the comment from Jira and posts the reply to the customer/changes the status of the linked tickets accordingly.  Normally the update needs to be scheduled to apply the change.  But in some cases issue can be fixed in TRUNK version (before release of a new version).

How to make a proper decision see the following notes:    Triage  All tickets with prefix TR-xxx on jira should have status TRIAGE in freshdesk ticket. Sometimes ticket on Jira could be moved to SS-xxx queue but in fact it could still requires a Triage. Such tickets could be detected by the following criterias:   see if some comment has been left in Jira ticket, it could help you to identify if this case has been already discussed and waits for Dev Scrum or it still requires Triage;  \u00a0if you see a future sprint has been set for the Jira ticket, then it means that ticket waits on Dev Scrum and status of FD ticket should be set accordingly;  if you see a\u00a0sprint number with past ver. then triage is needed and FD status will be Triage;  notify Arthur and Anton about newly created Jira ticket in \"support talks\" in Ryver.          Wait on Dev Scrum    Tickets that are waiting for Dev Scrum is almost always have a prefix SS-xxx. Only in some cases it could be a comment in Jira ticket that it still requires review on Triage or ticket depends on some other ticket and additional review on Triage requires.    Closed/Awaiting for implementation    \u00a0 If you see that \"Sprint\" field in some Jira ticket is not empty it \u00a0means that this ticket has been already scheduled for implementation.    Thus you can set status \"Closed/Awaiting for implementation\"                        ",
