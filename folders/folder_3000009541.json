    "description_text": "                       Different Commission models configurable in Sippy     In this commission scenario, we will assume that commissions are being paid to either a reseller of your voice services or as an Account Manager. A simple, single reseller model will be used as an example.     The two options that are configurable within Sippy are:   Rates-based commission method\u00a0- Commissions earnings from graduated rates structures. Configurations can be based upon either self-assigned profit margins - an exclusive commission model, or commissions earnings as assigned by you - an inclusive commission model.  Commission Agent method - Configuring a commission agent will pay a dividend of all calls of a specified entity to the Agent. An agent can either be an Account or Customer. The commission earned is a percentage of total call revenue.         1. Rates-based commission method  A\u00a0Customer\u00a0entity will be used for your reseller.   By assigning a \"Customer\" entity, you will be able to isolate all of your reseller's clients' calls and configurations within a Customer sub-structure.  The Customer entity creates a sub-structure additional to your primary business configuration. The result is a second layer of business management in an exclusive web environment and as a consequence results in a second layer of rates.  Configuring a Customer will provide restricted web access for specific use cases - such as resellers or some NOC support agents. System Management, Vendor, and Routing management are not accessible through your Customer web portal, with other privileges enabled/disabled on\u00a0the Permissions page.  The Customer sub-structure adds an additional layer of rates to your primary business configuration to allow for rates-based commissions.          \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Layer 1: Primary business configuration  Layer 2: Customer sub-structure  Destination Set  Tariff  Customer entity  Reseller's Accounts  Vendor rates - your Buy rates  Base sell rate is assigned to Customer.   Customer's Tariff (reseller's sell rates)   Reseller's Accounts (customers/users)  \u00a0  ie. Your buy rate + profit margin.\u00a0  ie. Your sell rate + additional profit margin for the reseller.\u00a0  \u00a0      The following diagram is to highlight the graduation of rates from Vendor to your reseller's customers/users:                       Layer 1 configuration overview:        Sippy's \"Destination Set\" is your Vendor's rate sheet - your Buy rates.  Sippy's \"Tariff\" is your customer's rate sheet - your Sell rates.  When creating a \"Customer\" the entity must be assigned a base Tariff. These are the base rates that all calls will be charged that are passed through your Sippy Softswitch from within the Customer.  Reports filtered for this Customer only will show all calls originating from all Accounts within the sub-structure, charged with the base tariff.  Your reseller's customers are managed by your reseller from their personal web portal, not as part of your primary business Accounts.  Your reseller's web portal accessibility/privileges can be managed through on the Permissions page on root customer's Customer Menu.   Layer 2 Customer sub-structure overview:   Your reseller has their own web portal that they use to manage their customers and their Tariffs.  Within the Customer sub-structure (reseller's web portal), the secondary \"graduated\" Tariff will then be assigned to your reseller's customers/users. The graduated Tariff is the resultant rates that are made up of:   Your vendor's rates + Your profit margin + Your reseller's profit/commission     Selecting whether to include commission in your Customer's Tariff will achieve moderately different commissions structures:  Exclusive commission\u00a0rates assigned to the Customer (reseller) will empower them to resell your services at a commission rate of their choice. The base Tariff will already have your business profit accounted for, resulting in a simple reseller model for you to manage.   Inclusive commission\u00a0rates assigned to the Customer will either:            Require manual accounting outside of Sippy for commissions remuneration at the end of a billing cycle, or  Require a Commission Agent to account for a total % of revenue to be aggregated to a separate entity.              2. Commission Agent method     A commission agent is an entity that will receive a percentage (%) of total revenue from every call made by another Account or Customer.  The percentage of revenue is calculated from the total call revenue from all billed calls, not from their profit margin.  The paid commission value will add to the Reseller's entity Balance and will display a resulting CDR from the call.      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Primary business configuration  Commission agent  Destination Set  Tariff  Account  Reseller entity (Customer)  Vendor rates - your Buy rates  Your sell rate is assigned. ie. Your buy rate + profit margin.  Calls billed by Tariff rates.  Received a percentage of revenue from every call by nominated Account.       The following diagram is to highlight the commission agent earning model:                        Commission Agent configuration overview:    Sippy's \"Destination Set\" is your Vendor's rate sheet - your Buy rates.  Sippy's \"Tariff\" is your customer's rate sheet - your Sell rates.  With this model, your reseller's Accounts are directly configured into your primary business configuration - the \"Root Customer\".  Your reseller's customers are managed by your company.  All billed calls from Account A1 & A2 will pay a designated commission percentage of total call revenue to the Agent.  The commission agent will receive a Balance adjustment in their account (positive or negative) for the earned commission from each call.  The commission agent will have a CDR relating to each call made and the resulting commission adjustment earned.       What are the advantages of each model?     1. Rates-based commission business model:    The Rates-based commission model empowers the reseller with increased control and management of their own customers.  Your company retains control of the Permissions that you wish to grant to your reseller's personal web portal as well as their base rate sheet and routing.  The Rates-based configuration can help segregate diverse business models on your Sippy Softswitch. Employing the multi-layered Customer entity can divide Wholesale from Retail business models, and direct business Accounts from your Reseller's Accounts, for example.  The multi-layered Customer concept will empower your resellers to recruit resellers of their own with a second layer of sub-customer. See the Customer document for more information.  Reporting is run on reseller-wide (Customer) activity.      2. Commission agent business model:     Your company retains management of each of your reseller's customers' Accounts.  Your base Tariff includes your profit margin and reseller's commissions for simplified configuration.

    "description_text": " General info     By default Sippy Softswitch allows you to apply only one tariff per Account. \u00a0The tariff is called \"Default\" in the examples below. From time to time, the tech team receives questions of how to configure and use different prices and different routing rules based on CLI (i.e. ANI based routing) or CLD (prefix based routing). \u00a0A configuration of these two solutions is shown below.     How to setup ANI/CLI based routing:     Task:   if ANI starts with 123, then apply Premium prices and route the call to a carrier with Premium quality  if ANI starts with 456, then apply Gold prices and route the call to a carrier with Gold quality  in other cases, use default prices and routes.      The setup assumes that you already have an Account which has been assigned a:   Default Tariff (i.e. default service plan) with default prices;  Default Routing Group with default routes   (if you don't, please refer to the Basic setup checklist)     First of all, you need to open Authentication Rules for the Account in question using the popup menu:       Next, click the Add button and define the options for the new authentication rule as below:       Then, add another authentication rule with a different ANI prefix, tariff and routing group (see below):       You can see every authentication rule has its own Tariff and Routing Group (Premium and Gold respectively). \u00a0A CLI translation rule may be required if you need to remove the prefix from the CLI.     Once it's done, you can check your setup using the Test Dial Plan tool.\u00a0 Here are two examples:     If ANI starts with 123:       If ANI starts with 456:       How to setup CLD prefix based routing:     Task:   if CLD starts with 444, then apply Premium prices and route the call to a carrier with Premium quality  if CLD starts with 555, then apply Gold prices and route the call to a carrier with Gold quality  in other cases, use default prices and routes      The setup assumes that you already have an Account which has been assigned a:   Default Tariff (i.e. default service plan) with default prices  Default Routing Group with default routes   (if you don't, please refer to the Basic setup checklist)     Next, you need to create authentication rules.\u00a0 Add one authentication rule as below:       Then, add another authentication rule as below:       You can see every authentication rule has its own Tariff and Routing Group (Premium and Gold respectively). \u00a0A CLD translation rule may be required if you need to remove the prefix from CLD.     Once it's done, you can check your setup using the Test Dial Plan tool.\u00a0 Here are two examples:     If CLD starts with 444:       If CLD starts with 555:       How to block calls based on either CLI (ANI) or CLD:     Task:   if ANI is \"Anonymous\", then block the call  if CLD has less than 10 digits, then block the call  in other cases, allow calls using default pricing and routing      The setup assumes that you already have an account which has been assigned a:   Default Tariff (i.e. default service plan) with default prices  Default Routing Group with default routes   (if you don't, please refer to the Basic setup checklist)     First of all, you need to create an authentication rule which will filter all calls that have a CLD shorter or longer than 10 digits:       The translation rule is:  s/^(\\d{,9}|\\d{11,})$/BLOCK/     Next, you need to add an authentication rule that will match all anonymous calls:       Once the rules are added, check how your setup works.\u00a0     He is an example of a call to a CLD that contains 11 digits:       Here is an example of a call from Anonymous CLI:          Summary     The examples provided above cover very simple use-cases in order to show you how to split traffic with prefixes. \u00a0Your requirements may be more complicated. \u00a0For example, in cases where more than two prefixes are required or where a verification of CLI/CLD length is needed, you can add as many authentication rules as are needed.

Incoming DID/CLD - means the number that the DID provider sends to the softswitch, it's the dialed number (CLD) and it's present in the URI part of the incoming INVITE request.     DID Translation rule - means the Translation Rule to be applied against the DID number after the call is authenticated. \u00a0The DID Translation Rule can be useful when the DID provider sends the CLD prefixed with \"+\" but you need to remove the prefix.\u00a0 Setting the value as \"12380023322\" means to translate everything to \"12380023322\" (i.e. equivalent to \"s/.*/12380023322/\").        3. As an additional measure Sippy recommends that you use the Vendor & Connection fields in the Authentication Rules section. This is for authentication of incoming traffic only from a specific Remote IP (IP from which DID provider's traffic will arrive at Sippy):     3.1 Add the DID provider as a Vendor and his gateways as Connections specifying real IP of your DID provider:          3.2 Set the Vendor and Connection in the settings of the DID number:          It is also possible to set a Vendor only. In this case it means that a call to the DID is allowed from Any connection of this particular Vendor.     Multiple Authentication entries are allowed too, they can be useful when the DID provider sends calls with a CLD in different formats and both calls should be authenticated. For example:          4. Next, click on Assigned to and tie your DID number with some Account or IVR application. This will result in the incoming call to the DID number being routed to a specific Account or IVR application:             5. If your call should be routed from the DID number to the registered Account, verify the Incoming Routing of account:                       6. The last step is to make sure that the Account assigned has On-net scope Enabled. Open the Routing Group which is tied to the Account and check On-Net Routing section:          Set everything to the default values recommended by Sippy and save Routing Group settings. More info...      Changes related to Rates, Routes, Destination Sets, Tariffs, DID numbers, DID Charging Groups and Routing Groups may not be applied immediately after you make them. \u00a0When you make changes, you need to wait at least 1 minute so that the system can update its internal \"cache\". \u00a0Sometimes, when you perform a \"heavy bulk\" update of (for example) multiple destination sets, the system may require more than 1 minute.
