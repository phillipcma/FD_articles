  "description_text": " REQUEST:  As a switch operator, I would like to have the possibility to block some exact CLIs/prefixes that Sippy receives from the trusted Remote IP.\u00a0     SOLUTION #1:     In Sippy 2020 DNC was implemented for CLI (calling) numbers: DNC CLI allows adding a list of CLI numbers so that calls with one of those numbers are blocked at Sippy Softswitch.  See more details by the following link:  https://support.sippysoft.com/a/solutions/articles/3000041461     SOLUTION #2:     1) Open the authentication rules of the desired account;  2) Create CLI translation rule which will convert CLI number to unknow prefix and as a result calls with unknown prefixes will be failing (example for prefixes 1 & 2):  s/^001/BLOCK/;s/^002/BLOCK/     Note, if a switch operator wants to block several prefixes in one rule he/she may use a semicolon between rules like in the example above. But switch operator should know that system applies rules sequentially.     If a switch operator wants to upload rules via CSV/XLS file it may be done in the following way:          Edit the download template by adding the needed rules: (A letter in the 1st column adds rule after upload):    Save file.     Select file by pressing \"Browse\" button and click \"Upload\" to upload file:          When the upload is done, you will see the following window:   ",
