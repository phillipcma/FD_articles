Note: This document is designed to complement the Sippy VoIP Softswitch Introduction Video Tutorial found in YouTube. \u00a0     Termination IP Authentication     As described in the video tutorial, IP Authentication is achieved with the termination supplier through the Vendor's \"Connection\" relationship (Vendor > Connection).     A \"Vendor\" is a termination supplier such as an Interconnect, a Carrier, a GSM Gateway, an IP-PBX or any other end point used for call termination by the upstream or egress side of a call. \u00a0Each Vendor can be assigned as many individual \"Connections\" as required, empowering flexibility for number translation, quality monitoring, capacity limitations, CPS limitations, etc.     The following images provide a brief overview of the steps required only to set up IP Authentication. \u00a0Additional configuration is required to pass calls successfully.

Provide a Connection Name for reference in the Connections table and add the IP address into the \"Destination\" field (see above). \u00a0Click \"Save and Close\" to add the IP address to your list of Authenticated IP's.             The Vendor's \"Connections\" table will show the IP addresses that have been configured. \u00a0You will note that in the screenshot above, IP 192.192.192.1 is presented as \"SIP:192.192.192.1\" thus indicating SIP as the protocol of the Connection. \u00a0        Note: If working with a new Sippy Softswitch, additional configurations are required to succeed in accomplishing what is highlighted in the next step of this document, specifically adding a new Connection to a Routing Group as a Routing Entry. \u00a0With existing routing and billing parameters already set up, following this document will result in a completed IP to IP authentication. \u00a0The YouTube video will walk you through the additional steps required. \u00a0You may also follow the\u00a0Wholesale Scenario checklist for additional information.        Origination IP Authentication     Once the base configuration is completed (Vendor's Rates, Routing Preferences, and Billing Parameters), IP Authentication for the call origination side can be configured.      An Account matches entries in the CDRs and a single Balance that relates to all authenticated calls from the originating source. \u00a0Accounts are flexible entities that can be used to fulfill various business and client requirements. \u00a0Digest Authentication and flexible CLI/CLD authentication methods can be used with Accounts. \u00a0Accounts are the elements against which IP Authentication for ingress traffic is checked (call origination). \u00a0Each Account can have as many specified \"Authentication Rules\" as required, thereby increasing security against fraudulent traffic, and providing flexibility for call routing and billing.

Additional parameters can be used for flexible authentication or restriction of traffic from a specified remote IP address. See\u00a0additional online resources\u00a0for more information.              The Account's Authentication Rules table will show the IP address that has been configured. \u00a0The example above shows IP address 1.2.3.4 was configured.        This completes the configuration of the call origination IP to IP model. \u00a0Your client will be able to pass calls using the configuration you set in his Account.
