What is 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) and Multi-factor Authentication?  2 Factor Authentication is a way to enhance security of your system. \u00a0In versions of our software from 5.2 and earlier we require simply a user name and password. \u00a0In practical terms access to the web interface relies just on something a user knows (user name and password). \u00a0A malicious user might try to brute force or guess the credentials to gain access to the system with some time and effort - thereby gaining access to something only the web user should know. \u00a02 Factor authentication extends this concept by adding another factor that the malicious user must try to obtain - making it much harder to gain access to the closed system. \u00a0In 2 factor authentication we still ask for something a user knows but we will now also ask for something the User has.     Multi factor authentication relies on two or more of these methods to prove your identity to the switch. \u00a0New to our Sippy 2020 version will be two methods to ensure users have the right credentials to enter the site. \u00a0\u00a0     Method 1: Email Based 2 Factor Authentication.  We will start with the most basic form of 2 factor authentication with an email based system. \u00a0All Web users (excluding accounts for the time being) will need to have an email address tied to their user profile. \u00a0Once an email address is attached then email verification can take place. \u00a0After successful Authentication using login&password, users will receive an email from the softswitch with a URL they will need to click on to continue on with their typical workflow or alternatively copy the security token into the web page presented on the web interface. \u00a0This security token represents something the user has and can verify their login access accordingly.     Switch operators will be able to define the Token Expiration and Token Validation period. \u00a0The tokens by default will expire within 5 minutes from being generated but this is configurable up to 1 hour. \u00a0A new token can always be created if you are unable to login within this time period but it will invalidate older tokens. \u00a0The validation period reflects how long a user can go for without verifying their user profile. \u00a0The validation period is set to 90 days by default and needs to be within 1 day to one year. \u00a0Both of these parameters can be set in the System Configuration table.     These emails can be localized on the users specific language and are saved in ./templates/{language_code}/mfa_verification_token.txt.     Method 2: Google Authenticator  Google offers a good 2 factor authentication model that we particularly like. \u00a0Users will have to download the Google Authenticator app from the App Store or Google Play store. \u00a0Its a common app and you should find it with relative ease. When a Web user tries to login for the first time they will be asked to scan a QR code in the Google Authenticator app. \u00a0From there the user will need to enter in a code presented in the app for the Softswitch. \u00a0This code is regularly changed according to the current time. \u00a0The code (a 6 digit number) is valid within less then a minute, this users will have to enter it in time to prove they have the necessary credentials to enter into the site. \u00a0This check is done every time user performs login going forward and we strongly suggest this feature be enabled for all regular web users.

There is a dropdown list with E-Mail Token, and Google Authenticator:    Once MFA is configured, system would display the warning about enabling MFA, though changes would be applied only after press of Save button.
