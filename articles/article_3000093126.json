  "description_text": " Starting from version 4.0, Sippy implemented an \"IP Firewall\"\u00a0that you may find in the \"Tools\"\u00a0section of the main menu.  The Firewall configuration menu was added to limit access to SIP/Web/DB based on the IP address.     Example of\u00a0default page:    Rules with IP addresses 0.0.0.0 and Netmask 0.0.0.0 mean ANY IP/ANY Subnet. \u00a0On the screenshot you can see that by default, SIP/Web access is not restricted (this means that you may have Web/SIP access from any IP). \u00a0Note, that \"access from any IP\" doesn't mean that any IP may login to your web interface bypassing the login credentials; it means that the login page would be visible to anyone who knows your IP address. The same applies for all other types\u00a0of rules.     If a switch operator wants to restrict access (e.g globally - for every entity in the system), he needs to first add the list of trusted IPs using the Rule \"Allow\", then he can Deny access with a global rule using the IP address 0.0.0.0 (blocking all IPs except the list of IPs added with the Rule \"Allow\").     Example for Web type:    Another possible approach (less secure), is to block only the list of suspicious/fraudulent IPs.

Example for Web type:     The same approach works for all other types of rules (SIP/DB/SSH).     Warning: For your security please review your\u00a0Firewall Rules and create rules to allow or deny access to your SoftSwitch. For some suggestions visit our support documentation\u00a0here.     A warning message informs switch operators that default rules with IP address 0.0.0.0 and Netmask 0.0.0.0 are in \"Allow\" state and may be potential security concerns.     To resolve this issue there are two options:  1) Add the list of trusted IPs and set Rule = \"Allow\" for all types of services and then block the default rules with IP addresses 0.0.0.0 and Netmask 0.0.0.0 (this blocks access for all IP's except the allowed list of IP's)  2) Upload/generate a valid SSL certificate following the documentation below:   Generate Letsencrypt certificate for free  Upload some other SSL certificate   2) Deselect the security alerts in the \"Security Alerts\" section             Other related/useful documentations:   Security management\u00a0     ",
