  "description_text": "                       Different Commission models configurable in Sippy     In this commission scenario, we will assume that commissions are being paid to either a reseller of your voice services or as an Account Manager. A simple, single reseller model will be used as an example.     The two options that are configurable within Sippy are:   Rates-based commission method\u00a0- Commissions earnings from graduated rates structures. Configurations can be based upon either self-assigned profit margins - an exclusive commission model, or commissions earnings as assigned by you - an inclusive commission model.  Commission Agent method - Configuring a commission agent will pay a dividend of all calls of a specified entity to the Agent. An agent can either be an Account or Customer. The commission earned is a percentage of total call revenue.         1. Rates-based commission method  A\u00a0Customer\u00a0entity will be used for your reseller.   By assigning a \"Customer\" entity, you will be able to isolate all of your reseller's clients' calls and configurations within a Customer sub-structure.  The Customer entity creates a sub-structure additional to your primary business configuration. The result is a second layer of business management in an exclusive web environment and as a consequence results in a second layer of rates.  Configuring a Customer will provide restricted web access for specific use cases - such as resellers or some NOC support agents. System Management, Vendor, and Routing management are not accessible through your Customer web portal, with other privileges enabled/disabled on\u00a0the Permissions page.  The Customer sub-structure adds an additional layer of rates to your primary business configuration to allow for rates-based commissions.          \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Layer 1: Primary business configuration  Layer 2: Customer sub-structure  Destination Set  Tariff  Customer entity  Reseller's Accounts  Vendor rates - your Buy rates  Base sell rate is assigned to Customer.   Customer's Tariff (reseller's sell rates)   Reseller's Accounts (customers/users)  \u00a0  ie. Your buy rate + profit margin.\u00a0  ie. Your sell rate + additional profit margin for the reseller.\u00a0  \u00a0      The following diagram is to highlight the graduation of rates from Vendor to your reseller's customers/users:                       Layer 1 configuration overview:        Sippy's \"Destination Set\" is your Vendor's rate sheet - your Buy rates.  Sippy's \"Tariff\" is your customer's rate sheet - your Sell rates.  When creating a \"Customer\" the entity must be assigned a base Tariff. These are the base rates that all calls will be charged that are passed through your Sippy Softswitch from within the Customer.  Reports filtered for this Customer only will show all calls originating from all Accounts within the sub-structure, charged with the base tariff.  Your reseller's customers are managed by your reseller from their personal web portal, not as part of your primary business Accounts.  Your reseller's web portal accessibility/privileges can be managed through on the Permissions page on root customer's Customer Menu.   Layer 2 Customer sub-structure overview:   Your reseller has their own web portal that they use to manage their customers and their Tariffs.  Within the Customer sub-structure (reseller's web portal), the secondary \"graduated\" Tariff will then be assigned to your reseller's customers/users. The graduated Tariff is the resultant rates that are made up of:   Your vendor's rates + Your profit margin + Your reseller's profit/commission     Selecting whether to include commission in your Customer's Tariff will achieve moderately different commissions structures:  Exclusive commission\u00a0rates assigned to the Customer (reseller) will empower them to resell your services at a commission rate of their choice. The base Tariff will already have your business profit accounted for, resulting in a simple reseller model for you to manage.   Inclusive commission\u00a0rates assigned to the Customer will either:            Require manual accounting outside of Sippy for commissions remuneration at the end of a billing cycle, or  Require a Commission Agent to account for a total % of revenue to be aggregated to a separate entity.              2. Commission Agent method     A commission agent is an entity that will receive a percentage (%) of total revenue from every call made by another Account or Customer.  The percentage of revenue is calculated from the total call revenue from all billed calls, not from their profit margin.  The paid commission value will add to the Reseller's entity Balance and will display a resulting CDR from the call.      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Primary business configuration  Commission agent  Destination Set  Tariff  Account  Reseller entity (Customer)  Vendor rates - your Buy rates  Your sell rate is assigned. ie. Your buy rate + profit margin.  Calls billed by Tariff rates.  Received a percentage of revenue from every call by nominated Account.       The following diagram is to highlight the commission agent earning model:                        Commission Agent configuration overview:    Sippy's \"Destination Set\" is your Vendor's rate sheet - your Buy rates.  Sippy's \"Tariff\" is your customer's rate sheet - your Sell rates.  With this model, your reseller's Accounts are directly configured into your primary business configuration - the \"Root Customer\".  Your reseller's customers are managed by your company.  All billed calls from Account A1 & A2 will pay a designated commission percentage of total call revenue to the Agent.  The commission agent will receive a Balance adjustment in their account (positive or negative) for the earned commission from each call.  The commission agent will have a CDR relating to each call made and the resulting commission adjustment earned.       What are the advantages of each model?     1. Rates-based commission business model:    The Rates-based commission model empowers the reseller with increased control and management of their own customers.  Your company retains control of the Permissions that you wish to grant to your reseller's personal web portal as well as their base rate sheet and routing.  The Rates-based configuration can help segregate diverse business models on your Sippy Softswitch. Employing the multi-layered Customer entity can divide Wholesale from Retail business models, and direct business Accounts from your Reseller's Accounts, for example.  The multi-layered Customer concept will empower your resellers to recruit resellers of their own with a second layer of sub-customer. See the Customer document for more information.  Reporting is run on reseller-wide (Customer) activity.      2. Commission agent business model:     Your company retains management of each of your reseller's customers' Accounts.  Your base Tariff includes your profit margin and reseller's commissions for simplified configuration.
