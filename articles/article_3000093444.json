Scenario #1: Onnet calls -> Trunk      When the Trunk is created, open the \"Incoming Routing\" page (marked as 3 on the \"How to set up a Trunk\" screenshot) \u00a0and select the Trunk required for the Source: On-Net Calls (as shown below):    FWD DID Mode\u00a0is not compatible with the configuration above and will not work     The Self Managed checkbox permits the management of Trunks on the Account's web self-care interface\u00a0  So, end-users/Accounts may Route all incoming On-Net calls that arrive on the Account to the desired Connection.          Click on the diskette icon to apply routing changes (see the screenshot above).        Scenario #2: DID ->\u00a0Trunk     When the Trunk is created, open the \"Incoming Routing\" page (marked as 3 on the \"How to set up a Trunk\" screenshot) \u00a0and select the Trunk required for the Source: DID <exact DID number>:    FWD DID Mode\u00a0allows you to keep the original CLD number forwarded to the selected Trunk     Selecting the\u00a0Self Managed option allows you to manage Trunks on the Account's web self-care interface.  So, end-users/Accounts may route all incoming On-Net calls that arrive on the Account to the desired Connection (screenshot shown in scenario #1).
