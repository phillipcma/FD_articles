  "description_text": " Flowchart Overview     These Customer and Vendor/Supplier Flowcharts will help guide you through the basic setup of your Sippy Softswitch.     This setup has been divided into two categories to help expose you to two sides of your Softswitch business and to simplify the setup of each side. \u00a0The first step is to configure the switch with information it will need to distribute and handle calls on the Vendor/Supplier Facing side, the second step is to mirror the structure of the service side of your business with the Customer Facing setup.\u00a0        Step 1     The Vendor/Supplier Facing setup is the basis of your call termination and routing. \u00a0This side of your Sippy Softswitch includes the Vendors, Destination Sets and Routing Groups tabs on the Customer menu. \u00a0These elements determine your own termination costs related vendors, routing rules and the preferences associated with running your business.             Step 2      The Customer Facing\u00a0setup is the basis of your charges to your customers. \u00a0This side of your Sippy Softswitch includes the Tariffs, Service Plans, Accounts and Customer tabs on the Customer Menu. \u00a0These elements determine your business setup and create a relation between the charges and plans you set for your customers.  \u00a0        These Flowcharts are created as 'flash cards' to take the confusion out of the terminology of the switch. \u00a0More detailed information and a step by step screenshot setup can be found under each of the System Elements.     Once the initial setup has been configured following these charts, your Sippy Support team will be able to tailor a training session to assist in completing the setup of your Sippy Softswitch.
