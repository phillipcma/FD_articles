  "description_text": " External Services     The existing external rtpproxy set up is not usable for any practical purposes, because all rtp goes in a single thread. The\u00a0Sippy Media Gateway\u00a0is the solution for your external media relaying requirements.   External Services is a feature allowing to off-load parts of the traffic processing to separate servers, effectively building a distributed cluster. This feature could be used in order to optimize media path as well as to increase maximum system throughput and make system more robust.  At the moment, only supported external service is media relay, known as RTPproxy and the Sippy Media Gateway.     Adding external media gateway:   Prepare the remote machine.   \n Download RTPproxy at www.rtpproxy.org or use pre-built package for your operating system if available\u00a0or contact sales@sippysoft.com for the fully supported Sippy Media Gateway.\n \n Build and install RTPproxy (skip this step if you are using the pre-built package). \n Run RTPproxy in the remote control mode using the following command:\u00a0 \n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $ rtpproxy -l <server_ip> -s udp:<server_ip>:<control_port> -F -L 19999   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Where <server_ip> is an IP address of the machine that will be used to run RTPproxy on, and <control_port> is UDP port  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0number that the RTPproxy will use to listen for connections from the Sippy Softswitch.     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02. Add corresponding External Service entry on Sippy Softswitch, setting up Service Type to RTPproxy, Hostname to \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <server_ip> and Port to <control_port>.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03.
