Sippysoft may proan ability to convert the Standby license to a dedicated Master license. But such a conversion requires reorganization of some configuration files.     From the sales perspective?????????????????????     1) The master server usually requires more support efforts.  2) Price for the Standby lower/higher??  3)     > Can I reinstall my license from scratch?      From the technical angle of view, the re-install of a license is a time-consuming process and may require a few days of work for its successful operation.  What actions might be required before the reinstall of the server:  1) Database(s) might need to be dumped/archived or replicated to some temporary allocated server. Otherwise, after the re-install, the stored data would be lost.  2) Code or custom changes might need to be also archived and copied to some temp server to keep them stored for future use.  3) If the customer uses VPN, better to store it's configuration details too.  4) Re-install may be done only for 3 latest supported versions of the system.  5) KVM for re-install of the license would be required.     From the sales perspective?????????????????????     > Can I migrate my environment to another license and what expenses should I cover?     Yes. SippySoft supports the environments migration to any other SippySoft switch, but the extra charge may be applied for the following tasks:  1) Migration of the environment;  2) If it is a hosted platform the IP change may be required that would also be charged extra.     > Can I manage my Flex license via SSH?   SippySoft doesn't provide an SSH/KVM access on a server that uses a Flex/Hosted license. The access on SSH may be provided only a Full Purchased system on self-hosted hardware.     > May I increase the CC/CPS on my hosted system?     Before the approval for the possibility of CC/CPS increase, Sippy Support checks the server on the required resource availability.  If the current server where the environment is hosted can handle more CC/CPS the technical team may increase that as soon as the customer paid for such an order. If the requested number of CC/CPS can't be handled on the current server, the support team in cooperation with the sales department may advise some alternative server for the migration of the environment for the use of a higher CC/CPS.     From the sales perspective?????????????????????     > May I get a standby solution if I use a SippySoft's hosted environment?     On the current stage, SippySoft doesn't provide the Standby functionality for the hosted solutions described above.  The Standby solution is available only for full purchased licenses.     > May I use for some time both servers simultaneously after the migration of data to a new server?
