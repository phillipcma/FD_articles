  "description_text": " This Documentation applies to the new Test Dialplan feature available starting from the 5.0 version of Sippy     Test Dialplan is a feature that allows softswitch operators to check the configuration of the system and to see how an incoming call is expected to be authenticated and routed within the system, with all charges applied.  Note: this tool only functions to check routing during the time it is being checked, it can not be used to check the results of calls in the past.          Starting from Sippy\u00a05.0, the Dialplan logic has been completely reworked; it now works based on xmlapi and mimics the call authentication and processing logic of the softswitch.     Supported call authentication scenarios:   Authentication rule of Account  call to DID assigned to Account [Registered Account Incoming Routing]  call to DID assigned to Account [Trunk Incoming Routing]  call to DID assigned to Account [Disabled Onnet, Routing Group case]  call to DID assigned to IVR application  Digest Authentication of account [Authenticated Call mode]  Outgoing call from IVR application [Authenticated Call mode]   DID Authentication rules are respected and processed properly     Not Authenticated Call mode:  Softswitch operators are able to enter the incoming CLD, Remote Address (optionally with port), incoming CLI and protocol (default SIP works in 99% of cases) to see how the call would be authenticated within Sippy, which Account/DID would be authorized for the call, the surcharges, etc.       Authenticated Call mode:  When the incoming call is expected to be authenticated via Digest Authentication, or the Account is authorized using the Sippy Calling Card IVR application, switch operators should select Authenticated Call from Mode in Parameters:    The Mode \"Authenticated Call\" makes it possible to select the Account in the \"Authenticated as\" field. \u00a0Once the CLD and CLI are entered, the call would be checked for that particular Account.\u00a0  Note: neither incoming DIDs nor the Authentication Rules of Accounts are checked in this mode!     Test Diaplan result parameters description:   Call Type - item related to call authentication and processing in Sippy. Could be Regular, On-Net, or IVR, depending on the scenario checked  Authentication Rule - the Account's authentication rule if it was used in the scenario being tested. Clickable link leads to the Authentication Rule settings  Routing Group - the Routing Group used in scenario tested. Clickable link leads to the Routing Group settings  Tariff - the Tariff used in the scenario tested. Clickable link leads to the Tariff settings  Prefix - the Tariff's rate prefix used in the scenario tested. Clickable link leads to the Rates settings  Price 1, Price N - the corresponding prices from the Tariff and the prefix Rate used in the scenario being tested\u00a0      Test Diaplan Routing Entries parameters description:     Routing Entries would be ordered based on the Routing Policy from the Routing Group that was used in the scenario being tested.  In most cases, the order would be the same as the order of calls sent within the scenario being tested. \u00a0The exception is when the Weighted Distribution Routing Policy is in effect; in which case, the calls would be distributed randomly based on the Weight.     The #0 line shows the CLI/CLD with the translation rules applied from the Authentication Rule (if used) and the Account's Incoming CLI/CLD translation rules\u00a0with the account_name\u00a0applied.  For all succeeding lines, the translated CLI/CLD is displayed based on the Connection's translation rule. The CLDs from #1 onward are the final ones, and are only sent to the Vendor, they are not used for call processing.  In the Media Relay column, the RTPproxy used would be displayed. \u00a0The default value - null, or Built-In RTPproxy (if the SMG is configured) would be displayed also.     The Timeouts section keeps current values of system timeouts:  100 timeout is taken from Reply Timeout, sec from Connection  1xx timeout is taken from 1xx Timeout, sec from the Destination Set's route prefix  2xx timeout is taken from 2xx Timeout, sec from the Destination Set's route prefix, unless the routing entry is the last in the list, in which case, the Final 2xx timeout, sec from Routing Group is shown     For the onnet/trunk cases the onnet timeouts from Routing Group are to be displayed instead.     In Current Channels/Max column the number of used capacity slots are displayed, in case the Capacity and Enforce Capacity are set on corresponding Connection. The information is displayed in real time, allowing the softswitch operator to see how many calls are hitting each connection at the moment of dialplan lookup.     Est. Cost is the estimated cost for the call, based on Average call duration (ACD) configured in the Tariff selected for this call, based on the authentication/authorization. This means the surcharges from Destination Set and Destination Set's route are calculated for the ACD and showed for switch operator as Est. Cost.       ",
