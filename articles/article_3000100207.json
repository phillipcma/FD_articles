  "description_text": " Sippy Softswitch 2020 introduces changes into authentication and charging procedures for a DID.  Authentication  The DID Authentication Rule has received two new fields: 'Incoming CLI' and 'Type'.    Incoming CLI  This attribute is now also considered during authentication of a call. The CLI supports an exact match only, no wildcard symbols are supported.  DID Authentication Type  Previously Sippy Softswitch allowed to specify only Remote Authentication Rules which work when a call arrives at softswitch. However there is another authentication present which was not configurable before. This another authentication is so called 'Late DID Recognition' and it takes place after a call has already been authenticated by Digest Authentication or Account Authentication Rule or Remote DID Authentication. The Sippy applies all the translations on the Account level and then checks if that CLD matches some DID number (but not Incoming DID number). And if there is such DID then the call is considered to be On-Net and it goes to the Account which is associated with this DID.  To be able to control this Late DID Recognition process a new type of DID Authentication Rule has been introduced and it is called 'Late'. If a DID has such rule in its list of Authentication Rules then the Late DID Recognition works as usual. If the Late Authentication Rule is removed then this DID will not be found by the Late DID Recognition procedure. Note: neither of configuration options of Authentication Rule (Incoming DID/Incoming CLI/Vendor) are applicable for Late Type.     Changes to DID charging  Selling DID Charging Group  The Selling DID Charging Group has lost the Per-Minute charge parameters such as Interval 1, Interval N, Price 1, Price N, etc and instead it has received a new attribute: an Incoming Tariff.\u00a0  For smooth transition for previously configured Selling DID charging Groups with Per-Minute charge parameters, new Tariff of type = Incoming with name that matches DID Charging Group is created with all charges inherited, and gets linked as Incoming Tariff to existing group.    Incoming Tariff  In order to charge an incoming DID call based on the CLI a new type of a Tariff has been introduced. It resembles the usual Tariff but does not contain many attributes such as Local Calling, Loss Protection, etc.\u00a0  New filter - Type - was added to Tariffs list page.  Incoming Tariff may contain many Incoming Rates. They are matched using a standard prefix match. There is a special prefix 'default' which matches when no other prefix has matched.
