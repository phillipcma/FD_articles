  "description_text": " This article presents questions and answers relating to our software versions and how they are supported     We want to make sure you have a good idea of how and when we decide that a software version has reached End of Support (EOS) status.     What Versions of our software are currently supported products?  Sippy Softswitch 5.1  Sippy Softswitch 5.2  Sippy SoftSwitch 2020     What versions are at End of Support?  Sippy Softswitch 5.0 and earlier     How does End of Support work?  We support 3 production versions. \u00a0The 3 versions supported will always be our 3 most recent versions; this will always be our newest release and two builds we consider \"stable\". \u00a0When a software release is moved to End of Support, it means that we no longer work on adding new functionality, patches, or security updates to support or maintain it. \u00a0If a patch had previously been created but not deployed we could apply it but no new patch would be be created.     How do I Update from end of support versions?  Updates are available from our support team if you are under an active support agreement. \u00a0Updates are included in our standard support agreements; our preference is to keep all our users on one of the most recent versions. \u00a0We understand that it is not always possible for customers to be on a recent version and that sometimes they have to cannot update their software version before it reaches End of Support. \u00a0If you happen to be on an older version, you can still upgrade to a newer version but there may be additional costs associated with the upgrade. \u00a0Alternatively, it may be easier to configure your system from scratch on the latest version.     Will my old software continue to work?  Absolutely. \u00a0Phone services are often business critical and scheduling maintenance is not always feasible. \u00a0Updating your software will always result in a greater array of new and innovative features, security fixes, and improvements. \u00a0The Softswitch will continue to operate reliably when we move a software release to End of Support.     Future Products and End of Support Timelines? As mentioned above, we try to keep 3 production versions of our software under support. \u00a0Ending the support of one release will typically coincide with the release of another. \u00a0When we release an Alpha of a software release we will make an announcement outlining our plans to end support for the oldest supported version. \u00a0The announcement gives our users enough time to begin testing the next update and decide if they are ready to move forward with the changes we made. \u00a0We schedule the actual end of support roughly 1 month following the release of the production version. \u00a0Some extensions may be provided for Partners who typically have several servers that may need to be updated.     When Will the next Version be moved to end of Support?  The Sippy SoftSwitch 5.0 version will be the next version to be moved to End of Support. \u00a0We are planning the announcement to be made during the first quarter of 2020. \u00a0After 5.0, the next version to be moved to End of Support will be 5.1, also during 2020.     What Versions of FreeBSD and PostgreSQL are supported by Version?  This question will depend on what version of our software you use. \u00a0For the latest information please check the following article on FreeBSD and PostgreSQL supported Versions.    ",
