  "description_text": "  Configuring and Understanding LRN Dipping and Number Portability      Overview     Local Routing Number (LRN) Dipping - Sequence of routing to terminate calls to a customer's phone number, inclusive of a Service Control Point server, to cater for Number Portability.\u00a0     Number Portability - Entitles owner of number to reassign their existing phone number to another carrier, location, service or provider.     The resulting configuration of both LRN Dipping and Number Portability, given the relative nature, is completed by the same method in your Sippy Softswitch.        Configure LRN Dipping and Number Portability     LRN Provider will provide you with required credentials for configuration of LRN Dipping process for your calls, enabling LRN and resulting Number Portability routing.   Add LRN server details in your System Parameters\u00a0menu. LRN Server Address is listed as IP address of external LRN Server. 1.1 Custom port is supported starting from Sippy 2020, in earlier versions it's hardcoded to send the INVITE to LRN server to his 5060 port, thus only IP address is expected there. 1.2 More then one LRN server could be configured as comma-separated list starting from Sippy 2021  If needed, change LRN Request Timeout - the time in seconds Softswitch waits for reply from LRN server (added in Sippy 5.2). Starting from Sippy 2021 it's possible to setup the fixed timeout for the case multiple LRN servers are specified, to request next LRN server from the list. Note, that this timeout is superseded by LRN request timeout, which limits total amount of time dedicated to perform LRN lookup for the call.  If caching of past requests to LRN provider is needed, set checkbox Enabled LRN Cache and select needed value for LRN Cache Expires in. Sippy stores LRN results for the set period of time, between 1 day and 3 months.  If Vendor requires to get number received from LRN server in RURI, starting from Sippy 2021 it's possible to add it by enabling the option in S  Enable LRN in your specified Routing Group. With LRN server configured, LRN lookup would be performed for any outbound call that is terminated through this Routing Group, either in cache or by doing extra lookup to LRN provider - case Enabled LRN Cache checkbox was not set, every call through such Routing Group would trigger lookup to LRN provider.  Specify LRN Translation Rule if required, according to our Understanding Number Translation. The listed rule of \"s/^/1/\" for example will add prefix \"1\" to every LRN query routed to your LRN provider, and will result in the call being charged according to your \"1*\" prefix Tariff.  Resulting CDR's of routed calls according to LRN Dipping and Number Portability will show with LRN_CLD in report.      Note: starting from 5.2 version case Local Calling is configured, Sippy might do extra lookup for CLI - in such case LRN_CLI would be added in CDR report.     Fields:     Enable LRN checkbox and\u00a0'LRN translation Rule' text field have been added to the Routing Group properties. For the case there is no Enable LRN checkbox on the routing group, no LRN lookup would be done. Ignore LRN\u00a0checkbox in the Vendor's Connection properties. If enabled then LRN CLD will be ignored for this routing entry and system will use prefix from route of matching destination set for the original CLD, using the rate from the tariff with LRN CLD to charge the customer for the call.  LRN Request Timeout\u00a0field in System Parameters - the time in seconds Softswitch waits for reply from LRN server (added in Sippy 5.2) LRN server address field in System Parameters - IP address of your LRN provider   Enabled LRN Cache and LRN Cache Expires in fields in System parameters - enable/disable local caching of successful LRN dips and time for keeping number and translated number in cache if it's enabled. The cache is checked before doing the lookup to the LRN server.     The call flow with enabled LRN dipping is as follows:     1. Call comes in.\u00a0  2. The Sippy softswitch applies the CLD Translation Rules from Authentication Rules and Account to the original CLD. The resulting CLD would be referred as 'The CLD'. More details on number translation could be found here.  3. Sippy sends the INVITE request to the LRN server with the CLD.\u00a0  4. The LRN response is rewritten with the 'LRN Translation Rule'. Let's call the result the \"LRN CLD\".
