  "description_text": " Feature Description:  The new feature added in 4.4 version of Sippy as a checkbox on Account preferences and Account Class. Note: setting from Account's class is applied only to newly created Account.

With Generate Ringbacktone enabled Sippy plays rings to the Caller on call's provisioning stage, case 180/183 messages were received from Vendor, up to receiving and processing 200OK from Vendor.
